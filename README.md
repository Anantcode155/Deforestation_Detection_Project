# Deforestation_Detection_Project
This project focuses on detecting deforestation from satellite imagery using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) techniques. The main goal is to support sustainability efforts by identifying regions where forest cover has been lost over time.

The system takes satellite images of land areas and classifies them into two categories:

🌳 Forest

🏜️ Deforested

By analyzing these images, the model can help environmental organizations, researchers, and policymakers monitor forest health and track changes in vegetation over time.


🌿 Deforestation Detection using Deep Learning

🧠 Week 1 – Design Phase Summary
Problem Statement

Deforestation poses a major threat to biodiversity, climate stability, and ecosystem balance. Manual monitoring using satellite or aerial images is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks scalability.
To address this issue, the project aims to develop an AI-powered Deforestation Detection System capable of automatically identifying deforested regions from images using deep learning models.

💡 Solution Approach

An intelligent image classification model was planned using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to distinguish between Forest (Tree Cover) and Deforested (No Trees) areas.
The system design includes data preprocessing, model training using Teachable Machine, and deployment using TensorFlow for backend prediction.

🗂️ Dataset Information

Dataset Name: Deforestation Detection Dataset

Source: Custom satellite imagery and open datasets (via Teachable Machine)

Description: Contains forested and non-forested images for binary classification.

Purpose: To automate forest cover analysis and aid environmental monitoring.

🧱 Design Activities

Identified dataset categories: Forest (Trees) and Deforested (No Trees).

Planned preprocessing: resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

Selected TensorFlow 2.20 for model integration and Python 3.13 as the environment.

Designed model export in SavedModel format for backend use.

Outcome:

Preprocessed test images (resizing to 224×224, normalization).

Implemented Python script for prediction and class mapping to descriptive labels.

Verified correct predictions for both forested and deforested test images.

📊 Results

Achieved accurate binary classification between Deforested and Forest regions.

Model demonstrated reliable real-time predictions on sample images.

Improved code to display class names and confidence scores.

🧾 Files Added
