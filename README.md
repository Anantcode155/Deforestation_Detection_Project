# Deforestation_Detection_Project
This project focuses on detecting deforestation from satellite imagery using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) techniques. The main goal is to support sustainability efforts by identifying regions where forest cover has been lost over time.

The system takes satellite images of land areas and classifies them into two categories:

🌳 Forest

🏜️ Deforested

By analyzing these images, the model can help environmental organizations, researchers, and policymakers monitor forest health and track changes in vegetation over time.
